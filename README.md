## Overview
### Introduction
  This project was created as a learning exercise during my early days of exploring web programming. It is not intended for commercial use or enterprise-grade deployment. As a result, the code may contain vulnerabilities, as the focus was on simplicity and functionality rather than robustness or security.
  
  If youâ€™d like to customize or improve the project, feel free to fork it and make your own changes. Please note that I am unable to dedicate time to refactoring or enhancing this project further.
  
  Thank you for understanding!
